## Building Intelligent GeoSpatial Search Applications with Azure Search

### About this Presentation
In this presentation, you will learn how to use Azure-Search to power geospatial search application. This is a hands-on demo during which you will learn how to do the following operations described below using Postman and then later on walk through an end-to-end multi-tier application that integrates an Angular Web Application, a .NET CORE Web API with an Azure Search backend to demonstrate the full range of geospatial capabilities of Azure Search:

- Create an Index
- List all Indicies within the Service
- Load Geospatial Records into an Azure Search Index
- Query for Records within and outside of a specific radius
- Query for Records within and outside of a specific polygon
- Query for Records within a specific distance inside and outside a pre-defined polygon
